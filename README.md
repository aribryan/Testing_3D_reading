# Testing_3D_reading



This is special guideline tutorial for loading image and display in tensorflow with Python, which includes couple of useful functions with useful implementation.
Additionally, for 3D camera projective geometry, there is a step by step depth data reading from the 
MVS_Synth dataset, and projecting the same on the neighbouring frame, with respect to a reference frame. 

You can easily follow this Jupyter notebook Python tutorial, the goal is to built a better 3D reconstruction via 
Machine Learning. This is a very basic introduction to it.

Go ahead. Try it out and happy coding. :)
